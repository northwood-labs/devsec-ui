## Overview

The [Racoon Attack] is a timing vulnerability in TLS that allows attackers to decrypt sensitive communications under specific conditions. The attack exploits a side-channel in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, relying on precise timing measurements and server configuration to break the encryption.

While the attack is complex and requires specific circumstances, it highlights the importance of secure server configurations and the potential impact of timing vulnerabilities on TLS security.
