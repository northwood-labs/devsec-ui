## Overview

[CRIME] is an attack against TLS that exploits information leakage from data compression before encryption. The attack, which requires server-side compression support and vulnerable clients, can steal session cookies and hijack sessions. While CRIME is easier to exploit than BEAST, mitigation is simpler by disabling TLS compression on servers and updating vulnerable clients.
