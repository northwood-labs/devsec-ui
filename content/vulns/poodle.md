## Overview

The [POODLE] attack is a security vulnerability in the obsolete SSL 3.0 protocol, allowing attackers to exploit protocol downgrades in many TLS clients to intercept and decrypt secure HTTP cookies or other sensitive data.

This occurs through weaknesses in SSL 3.0â€™s block cipher padding, particularly in CBC mode, which can be exploited via a padding oracle attack when a man-in-the-middle attacker manipulates network transmissions.

The best way to avoid this vulnerability is to _only_ allow TLS 1.2 (with recommended cipher suites) and TLS 1.3.
