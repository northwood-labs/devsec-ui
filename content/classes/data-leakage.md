## Overview

From [Wikipedia]:

> Despite developers' goal of delivering a product that works entirely as intended, virtually all software and hardware contains bugs. If a bug creates a security risk, it is called a vulnerability. Patches are often released to fix identified vulnerabilities, but those that remain unknown (zero days) as well as those that have not been patched are still liable for exploitation. Both software written by the target of the breach and third party software used by them are vulnerable to attack. The software vendor is rarely legally liable for the cost of breaches, thus creating an incentive to make cheaper but less secure software.
