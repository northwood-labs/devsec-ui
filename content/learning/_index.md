## Overview

Instead of only telling you **WHAT** is wrong with a website, we also want to educate about **WHY** something is a problem, and **HOW** you can go about fixing it.

If you feel that something is missing, or we can explain something better, please [create an issue](https://github.com/northwood-labs/devsec-tools/issues) and let us know!

## How does this stuff work?
