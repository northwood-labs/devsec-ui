## Summary

The [DES] algorithm was [developed at IBM in 1972][IBM], then [became a _Federal Information Processing Standard_ (FIPS) in 1977][FIPS-46].

It was [cracked in 1997][cracked], and was [removed from U.S. NIST standards (FIPS 46-3) in 2005][FIPS 46-3]. It is no longer considered secure.

Any cipher suite with `DES` in the name should be avoided.
