## Summary

[SHA-1] is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 160-bit hash value, but has been cryptographically broken and is no longer considered secure.

There were some [early cracks in the SHA-1 foundation][cracks] in the early 2000s. [NIST started the deprecation of SHA-1 in 2011][NIST], and the [CA Browser Forum deprecated SHA-1 certificates in 2014][cab]. [Google], [Microsoft], and [Mozilla] had public deprecation processes they were following when it was announced in 2017 that [SHA-1 had been fully cracked][shattered]. [Chosen-prefix collisions were proven in SHA-1][shambles] in 2020.

While still used in some applications, it is recommended to replace SHA-1 with [SHA-2]({{% relref "sha2" %}}) due to practical chosen-prefix attacks.

Any cipher suite with `SHA` (specifically `_SHA_`) in the name should be avoided.
