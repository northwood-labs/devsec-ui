## Summary

The [Digital Signature Standard][DSS] (DSS) is an overarching [U.S. federal standard][FIPS-186] which evolves over time. _One part_ of that standard is the [Digital Signature Algorithm][DSA] (DSA).

The _Digital Signature Algorithm_ signing method was developed by the [NSA], proposed by U.S. NIST in 1991, then [became a _Federal Information Processing Standard_ (FIPS) in 1994][FIPS-186]. In 2023, U.S. NIST [announced] that they were deprecating the _Digital Signing Algorithm_ in favor of [ECDSA]({{% relref "ECDSA" %}}) and `EdDSA`.

Any cipher suite with `DSS` in the name should be avoided. `ECDSA` signing should be strongly preferred.
