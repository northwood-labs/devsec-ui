## Summary

[SHA-2] is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the NSA, including `SHA-224`, `SHA-256`, `SHA-384`, and `SHA-512`. `SHA-256` and `SHA-512` are virtually identical, differing only in the number of rounds and shift amounts.

`SHA-2` was first published by NIST as a U.S. federal standard ([FIPS 180-4]) and is patented in the U.S. under a royalty-free license.
