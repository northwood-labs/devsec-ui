## Summary

The [Advanced Encryption Standard][AES] (AES), also known as _Rijndael_, is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm used to secure electronic data. It was selected by U.S. NIST as the modern standard for federal cryptography ([FIPS-197]), replacing [DES]({{% relref "DES" %}}). It became an international standard in [ISO 18033-3].
