## Summary

[Camellia] is a symmetric key block cipher developed by _Mitsubishi Electric_ and _NTT of Japan_, approved for use by [ISO/IEC][ISO 18033-3], [NESSIE], and [CRYPTREC].

It is considered a modern, safe cipher with security levels comparable to [AES]({{% relref "AES" %}}). Camellia has been adopted in various security libraries, protocols, and applications, including TLS, IPsec, Kerberos, and OpenPGP.

It became an international standard in [ISO 18033-3].
