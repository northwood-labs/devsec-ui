## Summary

[IDEA], a symmetric-key block cipher, was designed as a replacement for [DES]({{% relref "DES" %}}).

IDEA is slower and less secure than modern encryption algorithms. While IDEA was once considered secure, it has been broken using meet-in-the-middle and narrow-bicliques attacks, reducing its cryptographic strength.

Any cipher suite with `IDEA` in the name should be avoided.
