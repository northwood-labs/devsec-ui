## Summary

[GOST] is a set of international technical standards maintained by the Euro-Asian Council for Standardization, Metrology, and Certification. Originally developed by the Soviet Union, GOST standards cover various industries and are adopted by several CIS countries. They were declassified in 1994, and are the equivalent of the U.S. [DES]({{% relref "DES" %}}).

[GOST R] is a set of encryption standards for use by the government of the Russian Federation, and has **NOT** been accepted as an international standard. Its security has **NOT** proven and its use is **NOT** recommended by the IETF.
