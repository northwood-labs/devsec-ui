## Summary

Security never stands still. As soon as new methods are designed to secure data on the internet, there is someone working on ways to crack-open that security. Things that were secure 20 years ago are not secure today.

In {{% year %}}, there are only two configurations which are considered fully secure, and both should be offered to end-users:

### TLS 1.3

[TLS 1.3] is the most modern version of _Transport Layer Security_. The specification shipped in August 2018, and defines 3 cipher suites which are non-configurable.

### TLS 1.2 with _Forward Secrecy_

[TLS 1.2] is the next-oldest version. The specification shipped in August 2008, and defines several configurable cipher suites â€” most of which are _no longer_ secure, but there are still a good number that are compatible for the open web.

## Parts of a cipher suite

_Broadly_ speaking, there are four components to a cipher suite (as used in TLS):

* Key exchange
* Authentication signature
* Encryption algorithm
* Hashing function

If any one part of a cipher suite has an issue, it can compromise the integrity of the entire cipher suite.

## Known issues in classes of cipher suites

Security vulnerabilities can impact _classes_ of cipher suites.
