## Summary

[ShāngMì 3][SM3] is a hashing function standardized for use by the government of China, but has **NOT** been accepted as an international standard. Its security has **NOT** proven and its use is **NOT** recommended by the IETF.

It was published in 2010, and is considered similar to [SHA-256]({{% relref "sha2" %}}) in security and efficiency.

The ShāngMì algorithms are becoming mandatory in China.
