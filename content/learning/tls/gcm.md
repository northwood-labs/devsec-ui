## Summary

[Galois/Counter Mode][GCM] (GCM) is a mode of operation for symmetric key block ciphers that provides both data confidentiality and authenticity, enabling efficient and parallelizable encryption and authentication.

GCM is an authenticated encryption with associated data ([AEAD]) scheme, which ensures the integrity of both the encrypted data and any associated metadata. It is known for its high performance and minimal computational overhead.

Proper management of initialization vectors (IVs), which must be unique for each encryption with the same key, is critical to maintaining its security, as reusing an IV can compromise both confidentiality and integrity.
