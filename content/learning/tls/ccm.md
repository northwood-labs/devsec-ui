## Summary

> [!NOTE]
> "CCM" is a two-pass acronym which stands for _Counter with CBC-MAC_. In-turn, "CBC-MAC" stands for _Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code_.

[CCM] mode is a block cipher mode that combines counter mode for confidentiality with cipher block chaining message authentication code (CBC-MAC) for authentication. It is designed for block ciphers with a 128-bit block length and requires careful nonce selection to avoid security vulnerabilities. CCM mode is used in various standards like IEEE 802.11i, IPsec, and TLS 1.2 for authenticated encryption.
