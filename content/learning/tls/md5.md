## Summary

[MD5] is a widely used hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value, but it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities, including collision attacks.

Collision attacks allow for the creation of pairs of inputs with the same hash, making MD5 unsuitable for applications requiring collision resistance, such as digital signatures. Despite its well-documented weaknesses and deprecation by security experts, MD5 continues to be widely used.

Any cipher suite with `MD5` in the name should be avoided.
