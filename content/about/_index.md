We're a tiny company based in [Colorado] {{% emoji "us" %}}, near the [Rocky Mountains] {{% emoji "mountain" %}}, who thinks that software engineering {{% emoji "woman_technologist" %}}, site reliability {{% emoji "mechanical_arm" %}}, operations {{% emoji "whale" %}}, and cybersecurity {{% emoji "ninja" %}} are all parts of the same whole. We want to empower teams to build quality software and reliable services {{% emoji "1st_place_medal" %}}, teach where there are knowledge gaps {{% emoji "man_teacher" %}}, and make it possible for every user to have access to the best in security {{% emoji "dependabot" %}}.

Historically, most of the tools built to address these areas have done a poor job of integrating across all relevant disciplines {{% emoji "broken_heart" %}}, and can also cost a small fortune {{% emoji "moneybag" %}} in order to help teams ensure their products and services are well-built, reliable, and secure.

We believe that all of this can be made better, and we intend to try.
